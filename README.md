# GitHub Copilot in the CLI

GitHub Copilot in the CLI is an extension for [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) which provides a chat-like interface in the terminal that allows you to ask questions about the command line. You can ask Copilot in the CLI to suggest a command for your use case with `gh copilot suggest`, or to explain a command you're curious about with `gh copilot explain`.

For use cases, enabling, and limitations, see "[GitHub Copilot in the CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use/copilot-in-the-cli)".

For what data is collected, used, and shared, see "[Privacy Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/)".

For help troubleshooting connectivity, see "[Troubleshooting network errors for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/troubleshooting-github-copilot/troubleshooting-network-errors-for-github-copilot)".

> GitHub Copilot in the CLI does not currently have plans to support 32-bit Android distributions.
>
> For more information, see https://github.com/github/gh-copilot/issues/122.

### Multi-account notes

Multi-account users can use `--hostname` flag or `GH_HOST` environment variable to specify the GitHub hostname for commands that would otherwise assume the `github.com` host.

## Set up optional helpers

**Is `gh copilot suggest ...` too many keystrokes?  Do you want support for executing suggestions and keeping them in history?**

[`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/github/gh-copilot/releases/tag/v1.0.0) introduces `gh copilot alias`, which generates shell configuration for `ghcs` and `ghce` aliases that wrap `gh copilot suggest` and `gh copilot explain`.  These aliases provide faster invocation and support executing suggested commands if applicable.  Executed suggestions are added to your shell history for reuse later.

```shell
$ ghcs print "Hello world"

I'm powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. Make sure to verify any generated code or suggestions, and share feedback so that we can learn and improve. For more information, see https://gh.io/gh-copilot-transparency

Suggestion:

  echo "Hello world"

? Select an option
> Execute command

? Are you sure you want to execute the suggested command?
> Yes

Hello world
```

To setup these optional helpers, see below for setup instructions for supported shells:

- [bash](#bash)
- [powershell](#powershell)
- [zsh](#zsh)

For more information, run `gh copilot alias --help`.

For changing the execute command confirmation behavior, run `gh copilot config` to change `Default value for confirming command execution`.

### Bash

```bash
echo 'eval "$(gh copilot alias -- bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### PowerShell

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell users might need to update the file containing `gh-copilot` helpers after updating the extension.

```pwsh
$GH_COPILOT_PROFILE = Join-Path -Path $(Split-Path -Path $PROFILE -Parent) -ChildPath "gh-copilot.ps1"
gh copilot alias -- pwsh | Out-File ( New-Item -Path $GH_COPILOT_PROFILE -Force )
echo ". `"$GH_COPILOT_PROFILE`"" >> $PROFILE
```

### Zsh

```zsh
echo 'eval "$(gh copilot alias -- zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Metrics sent to GitHub

GitHub Copilot in the CLI sends certain metrics to our analytics system. We want you to understand what is being
sent and why it's important to our ability to continue to improve the product and provide you with a better experience
over time.

### Why do we need usage stats?

Our team uses metrics to prioritize our work and evaluate whether we are successful in solving real user problems after
we've released something. For example, when we release a new version and see a spike in exceptions and response ratings,
we want to understand if there is a regression or a platform issue causing problems.

The more people who opt in to send usage stats, the more information we have to base our decision-making on. And if you
want us to take your use cases into consideration, we hope you'll opt in so we get a better idea of how you use the app
and whether or not it's meeting your needs. GitHub Copilot in the CLI will send a payload in the format below to our
analytics system unless you've opted out. We are very sensitive to the privacy of our users and we never look at the data
of specific individuals, but rather only examine aggregate data and trends to inform our product decisions.

You can change your opt-in setting at any time in `gh copilot config`:

```
$ gh copilot config
